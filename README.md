That's the power of the *PickupMaster 9000*. This CS/math-themed pickup line generator is here to meet your needs, whether it's to complete the end of your pickup line or to practice honing your skills with you. By fine-tuning the pre-trained language model (PLM) GPT-2 from OpenAI with a wide variety of math and computer science pickup lines, we were able to generate coherent and subject-relevant pickup lines. We pull the PLM from the HuggingFace model hub and use the GPT-2 Tokenizer as well as Transformers Trainer class to process and train our data, then subsequently feed user input back through our fine-tuned model to generate a response. To facilitate user interaction with our model, we created a Flask app that takes in user input and generates 2 pickup lines from our fine tuned model - better than the PLM without fine-tuning! 

Below is a look at our Flask app in action!
