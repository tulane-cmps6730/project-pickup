This folder contains the final versions of the code we used to fine tune our gpt-2 model and generate responses from this fine tuned model. We also included the CSV files of the pickup lines we trained with, the pickup lines our model generated, and a human annotation csv where we recorded the coherence (gramatically) and relavence (if the output matches the content of the input).
